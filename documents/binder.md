There is an unfortunate downside to many crosslinkers. Because the mechanism of polymerization or crosslinking often requires breaking open molecules with free radicals, the chemicals in question can be a little spicy - like glycidol:

#### Poly(vinyl alcohol) / (vinyl acetate)

School glue Poly(vinyl acetate) and its precursor Poly(vinyl alcohol) are, in a regrettable turn of terminology, both known as PVA; and I spent a number of months thinking they were the same. Poly(vinyl alcohol) is probably better disambiguated as PVOH, but few use that term. It is, again, 







#### Sodium Alginate

As a complex biologically-derived copolymer, alginate crosslinks in a very interesting "egg box" manner, wherein calcium ions bind chains of the large alginate molecules together.

Alginate's simple $\text{Ca}^+$ mechanism and popularity in biomedical, molecular biology and dental circles makes it a pretty useful tool; many different methods have been. When thoroughly crosslinked, it can form a performant

(not iodide)

Unfortunately, calcium iodate is not particularly easy to come by; the only non-Sigma source I've found is a Russian ebay seller. It could be synthesized, of course, but that seems like a lot of hassle.

Citric acid is a great general-purpose dispersant; however, in this case it reacts with calcium carbonate to form calcium citrate, which is soluble in water.

3CaCO3 (ins. 10^{–9}) + 2C6H8O7 → Ca3(C6H5O7)2 \text{ (sol. 0.95 g/L @25C)} + 6H^+ + 3 CO3^- \\ 
then \\
H2CO3 → CO2 + H2O
$$

The calcium citrate  

The CO2 evolved can be useful in and of itself; it can produce a closed-cell alumina foam [paper on foams].

Unfortunately, this is again unsuitable for gel-casting, for the reaction goes to completion very rapidly.



Alternatively, a photoacid generator like [paper on alginate photoacid] Pyranine (easily obtained from yellow highlighters) can be used to make this reaction UV-triggered [it is interesting to note that this UV crosslink trigger is different from that of PVA, where the benzoate was frickin' sliced and diced via radiolysis, and the crosslink formed in its grave by unknown means.]. No testing was done on this. A thermal acid generator could also be useful for this reaction.

*Incidentally, this gypsum + alginate polymer is somehow ridiculously fireproof - several minutes of direct flame has no effect.*

But - of course - this was dumb. The reason why calcium iodate is so desirable is its precipitous change in solubility with temperature. 



#### Gelatine

If you thought alginate was complex and ill-defined for technical use, get a load of gelatine. This is a wide-cut protein mix extracted by acid hydrolysis of animal protein. Because of its natural source, formal specifications for gelatin composition do not generally exist, and properties may vary greatly between sources. Gelatin is specified by "Bloom", a gel strength metric that roughly correlates with molecular weight. The gelatine used in these experiments was porcine-derived.

Interestingly, the molecular weights that cause high viscosity in gelatine solutions are not the same as those which confer strength; that is, strength and viscosity can be varied relatively independently:

To quote the gelatine handbook:

> Thus, the gel strength is mainly dependent on the proportion of fractions having a molecular weight of approx. 100 000 g mol, whereas the viscosity is primarily a function of those in the molecular weight range of 200 000 to over 400 000 g mol. For this reason, depending on the method of manufacture, gelatines of the same Bloom value can have quite different viscosities.

Gelatine has a very complex gelation behavior, involving proteins folding around each other, etc. This makes it very

Your ceramics should be fully cooked to prevent salmonella. 





Many papers describe a binder burnout pause at, variously, 350 to 550c. This didn't seem to be necessary in my testing. If moisture content is excessive, insufficient binder strength, or, the green usually explodes at around this temperature.

Sintering moisture content could be specified gravimetrically, of course,  but this has not yet been done.
