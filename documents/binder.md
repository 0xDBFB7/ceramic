As a complex biologically-derived copolymer, alginate crosslinks in a very interesting "egg box" manner, wherein calcium ions bind 'zipper-shaped' sections of the large alginate molecule together. 



If you thought alginate was complex and ill-defined for technical use, get a load of gelatine. This is a 'wide-cut' protein mix extracted by acid hydrolysis of animal matter. Because of its natural source, formal specifications for gelatin do not generally exist, and properties may vary greatly between batches. Gelatin is specified by "Bloom", a gel strength metric that roughly correlates with molecular weight. The gelatine used in these experiments was porcine-derived.

Interestingly, the molecular weights that cause high viscosity in gelatine solutions are not the same as those which confer strength; that is, strength and viscosity can be varied relatively independently:

To quote the gelatine handbook:

> Thus, the gel strength is mainly dependent on the proportion of fractions having a molecular weight of approx. 100 000 g mol, whereas the viscosity is primarily a function of those in the molecular weight range of 200 000 to over 400 000 g mol. For this reason, depending on the method of manufacture, gelatines of the same Bloom value can have quite different viscosities.

Gelatine has a very complex gelation behavior, involving proteins folding around each other, etc. This makes it very

Many papers describe a binder burnout pause at, variously, 350 to 550c. This didn't seem to be necessary in my testing. If moisture content is excessive, insufficient binder strength, or, the green usually explodes at around this temperature.

Sintering moisture content could be specified gravimetrically, of course,  but this has not yet been done.
