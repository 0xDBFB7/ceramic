I was not sure weather isolation would be required. In the end, simple interlocks were added to ensure 



Commercialization of furnace.

OF COURSE! We bridge rectify and filter the AC input to get a higher voltage for commercialization without a variac. Could also perhaps 

OTOH, we should probably have isolation on the high-voltage side anyways, to prevent sparky gefingerpoken; high-freq xformer required then.

OTOH, the element could be put behind a ceramic baffle. I mean, toasters have exposed elements.

OTOH, what about 220v countries? There are 220v HSIs, but they're rare. 



Let's try to avoid feature creep here. Let's require USB power to avoid a bootstrap supply. This also lets us do away with the LCD screen.

Voltage measurement - V->F converter then through optocoupler?
