# What worked

This process was taken almost verbatim from *Cross-linked Polyvinyl Alcohol as a Binder for Gelcasting and Green Machining* by Chabert et al. 

- Despite having tried numerous binders, I cannot say with any confidence that this is an ideal process; it is merely sufficient for my needs.
- If large-scale production is desired, see FAST.

## The recipe

#### Add 90% or 70% by weight of aluminum oxide powder to a small beaker.

This can be obtained for ~$10/kg at any pottery store worth their frit; it is often known as "calcined" alumina.

The grain size was not specified; however, <3 micron grains seems to be typical for technical ceramics.

Mixing by weight appears to yield a more reliable mixture.

#### Add between 10 and 30% Kaolin clay.

This is 



| Example 5g 90% alumina batch parameters |      |
| --------------------------------------- | ---- |
| Alumina                                 | 4.5  |
| Kaolin clay                             | 0.5  |
|                                         |      |
|                                         |      |

## What didn't work



#### Mistakes made







In my style of R&D (that is, essentially a random walk towards success), I have found that the lag time between obtaining new data and having the results of tests based on those data is a strong predictor of success.

This lag can stretch testing over a longer period of time, of course, but it can also trigger human factors like boredom and burnout. I have recently endeavored to minimize this lag time wherever possible, to great effect.

To this end, I looked to build a small kiln more suitable 



If there is an interminable wait between those driving pulses of excitement and mystery, . A researcher is lab equipment like any other; requirements must be met for them to operate properly.

This idea permeates throughout the software world to such a degree that even a 10-second compile or unit test time is viewed as unacceptable.

Indeed, even if unit testing did not produce more correct code, it would still be worthwhile purely due to the decreased amount of time required to test changes.

Perhaps my greatest engineering blunder to date was to forfeit unit testing in a 10k SLOC embedded codebase, ostensibly to save time. Development crawled for years; code not demonstrated to be correct combined with unstable hardware to form a hellish impasse of incomprehensible failures; but, perhaps most critically, the effect of code changes took minutes to observe. This dismal crawl was reflected not only in my work, but also in my attitude and behaviour.

The software world is measurably different from other types of engineering; many concepts cannot be transferred out of this world of bits. When NASA conducted an assessment of the TRL system, all domains responded well - with the exception of the software teams:

> Feedback from the NASA Software community indicated that the TRL Table
> Software definitions are not used. Other means (e.g., capability maturity model integration
> (CMMI) and others) are used to characterize software maturity and no one uses the TRL Table
> definitions.
>
> Recommendation: Eliminate the Software columns from the NPR 7123.1B TRL Table.

An additional benefit is wrought; the optimizations required to efficiently test new developments are often also effective production optimizations.
