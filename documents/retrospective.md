It may be interesting to note a few philosophical things about the process.


The test coupons that you use should be as small, fast, and easy as possible while still reflecting the
desired end product. For instance, if you use an oversimplified test coupon, you might start overfitting your
process to get good results on the coupon, rather than the final product you need. Don't overthink it though.

For some reason, the tests that I ran were largely sequential; run one mixture, observe the effects,
modify the mixture slightly, etc. Parallelizing and pipelining may have made this go faster.

A very, very large number of dump

It seems to be something of a common theme for me to start with a solution that *almost* works, is 80% of the way there,
then do rote, menial work for months, only to end up with a product with is identical to the starting point.

In my last company, for instance, the first two (simple) revisions of a board essentially worked, despite resetting occasionally.
The design was reworked substantially, then, over the course of 14 revisions and 3 years, strayed very little - and eventually converged back
to the very same design which substantially worked despite resetting occasionally.

In this case, I tried the gelatin process you see here very early on, but made a very dumb mistake in the mixture ratios (adding far too much water),
which lead to binder migration, which lead me to believe that gelatine was ineffective.

I haven't a goddamn clue how to break out of this cycle. Just abandoning everything for a new startpoint wouldn't be very helpful, I don't think.
Maybe it's something like you can't fix deep-set issues by just changing minor details. Maybe that's just the way science works.

I also very nearly ragequit the project 3 or 4 months in, after all the tests were failing. It seems to be important not to do that.

#### Constrained resources

On one hand, not having $2000 to drop on a high-temp kiln was greatly beneficial, for it forced
learning all about high-temp kiln design. On the other hand, much time was wasted trying to troubleshoot sintering something
which could never have worked with the kilns that I had, thinking the problem was the binder when it really was the kiln.

Testing and characterizing each section sequentially with known-good equipment, then applying optimizations might have been more effective than this
'all-up' test.
On the other hand, it worked out okay, so I think I'll stay with this method.

Don't do that, I guess?

I don't know what meta changes can be made to break out of this cycle. Just abandoning everything for a new startpoint wouldn't be very helpful, I don't think. Maybe it's something like you can't fix deep-set issues by just changing minor details. Maybe that's just the way science works.
