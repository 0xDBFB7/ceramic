<li>At these temperatures, you can expect everything to be on fire. Wearing clothes that burn rather than melt is recommended, particularly when working with large commercial furnaces.</li>
<li>Parts with wet binders often explode on burnout, spraying superheated ceramic spall in all directions. A face shield is recommended.</li>
<li>Binder decomposition products can be quite noxious.</li>
<li>SiC elements are uninsulated and present an electrocution hazard and also emit carbon monoxide.</li>
<li>Working with aluminosilicate firebrick and fine alumina powders presents a risk of various pulmonary diseases and some (unsubstantiated) risk of neurological damage. Wear a respirator.</li>
<li>Some techniques discussed may involve the formation of titanium oxides, risking metal fume fever (see the case report of <span class="citation" data-cites="Acute2008">Otani, Ishimatsu, and Mochizuki (2008)</span>).</li>

<p>A few years ago ago I was lucky enough to have some time to tinker with high-temperature ceramics. Little of value was determined, primarily just empirical nonsense, but I figured I would quickly dump the most useful facts into this document. Nothing reported is even slightly novel; many of the Vacuum Hackers have much more expertise on ceramic blends, and you should probably talk to them instead.</p>
<h4 id="hot-surface-igniters-commonly-used-in-gas-furnaces-for-central-heating-are-a-fantastic-commodity-source-of-pre-terminated-silicon-carbide-heating-elements.-they-appear-to-be-usable-at-1400-c-continuously-with-20-minute-bursts-to-1600-c-in-air-and-probably-well-over-2000-c-in-inert-gas-or-vacuum.">~$30 “hot surface igniters”, commonly used in gas furnaces for central heating, are a fantastic commodity source of pre-terminated silicon carbide heating elements. They appear to be usable at 1400 C continuously with 20 minute bursts to ~1600 C in air, and probably well over ~2000 C in inert gas or vacuum.</h4>
<p>It’s relatively easy to get to 800 C or so with standard heating elements, microwave susceptors, or gas torches, sufficient for some low-fired &gt;30% kaolin ceramic blends. With care in heating element support, termination, and insulation, commercial “high-fire” ceramics kilns can usually reach about 1300 C.</p>
<p>However, a very useful class of techniques demand a minimum of 1400 C, including the most useful high-purity oxide ceramics (see awesome data from <span class="citation" data-cites="Sintering1957a">Cutler et al. (1957)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="Vitreous1942">Luks (1942)</span>), even if sinter-point-depressing additives are used. Furnaces which can reach such temperatures are usually quite expensive. Small zirconium sintering kilns are available, ostensibly for dental work, usually using MoSi2 heating elements, but these usually cost over $1500. Acetylene torches do not offer the required control over temperature ramp rate and produce strong thermal gradients.</p>
<p>Some alternative techniques can often be used in specific circumstances, such as field-assisted sintering (thanks <span class="citation" data-cites="ice9">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="ice9"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>).</p>
<p>However, a general-purpose desktop furnace for small parts seemed like a pretty useful piece of equipment.</p>
<p>More critically, if a vacuum furnace is desired, standard chromium-based heating elements degrade very rapidly. See <span class="citation" data-cites="mazelsky1974multipurpose">Mazelsky et al. (1974)</span> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The next factor investigated was the suitability of Kanthal A-1 as heater material. Although this material is suitable for use to 1325 C in air, at least one reference does not recommend its use in vacuum at temperatures over 1000°C. This warning is founded in the rapid evaporation of a component (chromium?) from the alloy and verified by tests we performed on bare wires in ultra-high vacuum. Sample filaments burned out after two hours or less at a surface temperature of 1200°C.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a high vacuum or inert atmosphere is available, sufficiently pure graphite or tungsten boats can be an acceptable heating elements, but it takes some effort to work around the low resistance of these materials.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../media/hsi.JPG" style="width:100.0%" alt="" /><figcaption>Sparkly!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I recommend a <code>CoorsTek 271N</code> (equivalent to <code>Emerson 767A-372</code>) SiC HSI ($33 CAD pre-pandemic on Amazon) or equivalent with fiberglass wire insulation, Steatite C220 or Alumina body and nichrome wire. Beware elements with Teflon insulation. Both recrystallized SiC and SiN HSIs are available. The SiC elements are preferable due to the higher temperature resistance of SiC and a more rugged construction overall. SiN HSIs also often specify an 80v DC supply for reasons unknown.</p>
<p>SiC HSIs are mechanically delicate, but seem to tolerate ceramic spall and contamination relatively well.</p>
<p>Note that 220V elements seem to be quite rare: it appears to be hard to fabricate something with a sufficiently high resistance.</p>
<p>HSIs are apparently used because sparks do not provide the energy needed to ignite natural gas with perfect reliability over decades.</p>
<p>Getting above ~1500c involved increasing the 115V line voltage to about 135 V using a Variac. This does speed up element degradation a bit.</p>
<h3 id="degradation">Degradation</h3>
<p>You can expect an element lifespan probably on the order of about 500 minutes at 130v in air.</p>
<p>Degradation occurs via a <em>fascinating</em> multi-step oxidation reaction described in detail by <span class="citation" data-cites="Bubble2015">Raj and Terauds (2015)</span> that evolves carbon monoxide and inflates large bubbles of carbothermally reduced silicon stuck to SiO2 (if I’m understanding correctly - unlikely, given my poor chemistry prowess!):</p>
<p><img src="assets/my_photo-bubble4.jpg" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>Interestingly, a very similar “bubbling” failure mode was seen (<span class="citation" data-cites="Oxidation2008">Jacobson et al. (2008)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="NDE2010">Roth et al. (2010)</span>) on the reinforced-carbon-carbon panels on the leading edges of the space shuttle, which were coated with SiO and SiC for oxidation protection.</p>
<p>Such a carbon-carbide “conversion coating” seems to be relatively easy to perform in a furnace such as this one; see Tonsil 5 for details. SiC elements are also used on the ALQ-144 IR missile jammer, so it’s unlikely that my lab will be hit with a missile in the near future.</p>
<h2 id="kiln-1">Kiln 1</h2>
<p><img src="assets/kiln.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>This kiln was built using a single Amaco <code>28035N</code> 9" by 4-1/2" by 2-1/2" aluminosilicate firebrick ($15 pre-pandemic, Amazon) cut and pocketed using a wet tile saw (although a hacksaw would work fine); the element was then mounted with fire-cement (<em>Imperial High-Temp Stove and Furnace Cement</em>). The element was inserted through a slit in the firebrick to shield the terminals somewhat. Let cement dry overnight, then slowly raise temperature over course of ~30 minutes.</p>
<p>The firebrick does begin to degrade over the course of a few hours when running at 1500 C.</p>
<p>The alumina-foam firebrick is quite delicate, and the end-cap to which the element was mounted later broke during handling. Mounting with threaded rods and large washers is recommended.</p>
<p>I really like this furnace. It typically reaches 1000c in one minute, and ~1400c in the next five to ten, allowing for very rapid iterative testing (useful for my crude, blunderbuss style of R&amp;D). It can also toast bread in 2.4 seconds. Some green binders (gelatine, for instance) are sensitive to temperature ramp rate. PVA seemed unfazed by these crazy dT/dts.</p>
<figure>
<img src="assets/kiln2.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="" /><figcaption>Bread is not unfazed.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A PID control system can be added with an SSR: P: 1, I: 1, D: 2 to 6 based on thermocouple response, and integral windup limits of -300, 300 seems to be an acceptable starting point.</p>
<p>Typical ratings range from a tepid 980 C at 102v to a positively balmy 1705 C at 132v (<span class="citation" data-cites="HighPerformance2017">Inc (2017)</span>). Expect consistent 3.7A draw over entire temperature range.</p>
<figure>
<img src="assets/test_2.png" style="width:100.0%" alt="" /><figcaption>Flat-out temperature profile. Note that the MAX31855 thermocouple transducer stopped reading at about 1700 seconds and only recovered at 2200 seconds.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Standard thin K-type thermocouple wire can operate briefly at 1400c; McMaster-Carr’s #3859K44 thermocouples survive 1400c for a few seconds before being incinerated, though the high thermal mass leads to a ~200 C offset in this application (seen in the graph above).</p>
<p>Non-contact temperature measurement is more suitable, though all COTS bolometers begin to whimper at these temperatures.</p>
<p>The best option for temperature measurement is probably a <strong>disappearing-filament pyrometer</strong>. These are trivial to build.</p>
<p>If a Vis spectrometer is available, fitting the pleasant glow of the furnace to the Stefan-Boltzmann law can probably get you within a few hundred degrees.</p>
<p>A ratio pyrometer built from two photodiodes (or phototransistors, depending on your bias) with IR-cut and IR-pass filters may also work.</p>
<p>These techniques are complicated somewhat by alumina’s selective radiation: the spectral emissivity curve looks like someone put overcooked pasta into Matplotlib. Worse still, it varies with temperature by about half an order of magnitude. I’m disappointed to find that ‘spectral emissivity’ has nothing to do with ghosts.</p>
<h2 id="kiln-2-and-speculation-on-next-steps">Kiln 2 and speculation on next steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Firebrick is crumbly and unlikeable.</li>
<li>Many interesting techniques require an inert or nitriding atmosphere.</li>
<li>In a rough vacuum, it should be possible to exceed 1,700 C continuously, probably limited only by the temperature at the nichrome termination.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most insulating materials that can withstand such temperatures are expensive or difficult to work with. Because of the <span class="math inline">P ≈ T<sup>4</sup></span> nature of the Stefan-Boltzmann law vs the approximately linear dependence of conduction, at such high temperatures radiative insulation is the primary concern. For this reason, many layers of multi-layer insulation may suffice.</p>
<p>The advantage here is that the efficiency of MLI depends only weakly on the emissivity and conductivity of the insulation. For this reason, a stack of machined graphite may be sufficient.</p>
<p>20 oz vacuum-insulated wine tumblers seem to make excellent chambers for this purpose.</p>

<h4 id="tonsil-0-binders">Tonsil 0: Binders</h4>
<p>‘Gel-casting’ is a technique where a slurry of ceramic powder mixed with a low-viscosity monomer or polymer (prototypically acrylamide, but now various others <span class="citation" data-cites="Development1998">Janney et al. (1998)</span>) and crosslinker is injected into a mold, after which the crosslinker is triggered to form a solid green. This appears to be in vogue for ceramics production. Some advantages include very low binder percentages and correspondingly low green drying and firing shrinkage. Some effort was put into evaluating various gel-casting binders. (<span class="citation" data-cites="Crosslinked2008">Chabert, Dunstan, and Franks (2008)</span>)</p>
<p>However, aqueous gel-casting has a notable drawback in that most common binders tend to entrain water, meaning that even thin cross sections take many hours to properly dry. A solution of PEG can apparently be used to accelerate this drying <span class="citation" data-cites="Drying2003">Barati, Kokabi, and Famili (2003)</span> - I haven’t tried this. The required crosslinking activators and are also usually difficult to obtain for the hobbyist.</p>
<p>(Note that, confusingly, both PVAc, poly(vinyl acetate), and PVOH, poly(vinyl alcohol), are each often referred to as ‘PVA’, despite having completely different properties. Standard white glues are an emulsion of primarily PVAc and some PVOH).</p>
<p>Alginates are a pretty neat tunable binder; the molecules cross-link together whenever a Ca+ or Mg+ ion is present in solution, meaning that the viscosity and trigger can be tuned with various chelators or solvents <span class="citation" data-cites="Fabrication2003">Jia, Kanno, and Xie (2003)</span>.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice flour <span class="citation" data-cites="Study2014">Wan et al. (2014)</span> is the strongest readily-available gel-casting binder that I’m aware of.</p>
<p>I have, however, had much better results from low-pressure injection molding with a paraffin wax binder. Several suitable binders are discussed in <span class="citation" data-cites="EVALUATION1965">Teter (1965)</span>. A plastic syringe suffices for injection.</p>
<p><img src="assets/Screenshot%20from%202019-06-03%2020-11-28.png" style="width:50.0%" /></p>
<h4 id="tonsil-1-brazing">Tonsil 1: Brazing</h4>
<p>Alumina can be readily brazed using titanium <span class="citation" data-cites="Sealing1957">Beggs (1957)</span>. This requires only a titanium interface layer; several fancy intermetallics are formed and the titanium adheres strongly to the alumina. The entire process must take place in a high vacuum or exceptionally clean argon atmosphere, else inert titanium oxides and nitrides will form.</p>
<p>A soft copper or Kovar interface layer is often used to prevent the differing thermal coefficients from cracking the ceramic when the weld cools.</p>
<p>See <span class="citation" data-cites="Brazing1988">Hammond, David, and Santella (1988)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="it2009">Consultants (2009)</span> for details.</p>
<h4 id="tonsil-2-mno_2">Tonsil 2: <span class="math inline"><em>M</em><em>n</em><em>O</em><sub>2</sub></span></h4>
<p><em>Vitreous high alumina porcelain</em>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Vitreous1942">Luks (1942)</span>, describes how Manganese Dioxide can be used to depress the sinter point of pure alumina to more reasonable temperatures, sometimes without the use of silica. An impure, graphite-contaminated <span class="math inline"><em>M</em><em>n</em><em>O</em><sub>2</sub></span> can be obtained from alkaline batteries; unfortunately, I have note yet been able to reproduce this effect to any degree.</p>
<p>The effects of sintering additives on the development of the crystalline structure are very interesting and counterintuitive (<span class="citation" data-cites="Controlled1976">Brook (1976)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Bulk2009">Hine et al. (2009)</span>). It would be interesting to see if these effects can be predicted with some fidelity by modern molecular dynamics procedures. I have done no research in this area - this may already be common practice.</p>
<h4 id="tonsil-3-cataphoresis">Tonsil 3: Cataphoresis</h4>
<p>A PVA-bound alumina solution can be thinned considerably, and various objects can be dipped to form hard coatings. Attempts with graphite and aluminum have been successful; however, obtaining a uniform, tight-tolerance layer is somewhat difficult.</p>
<p>If such a layer is required, a variant of electrophoresis can be used; see <span class="citation" data-cites="Electrophoretic1997">Ferrari and Moreno (1997)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="influence2004">Lazic et al. (2004)</span> for details. This technique is apparently often used to insulate indirectly heated cathodes.</p>
<h4 id="tonsil-4-beta-alumina">Tonsil 4: Beta-alumina</h4>
<p>Alumina can be found in two main allotropes: alpha-, and beta-. (and sapphire).</p>
<p>To my (surely flawed) understanding, the chief difference lies in the ionic conductivity, which allows for hermetic low-temperature anodic bonds to some materials using the esoteric Johnsen–Rahbek effect. See <span class="citation" data-cites="FieldAssisted1979">Dunn (1979)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="tonsil-5-foam">Tonsil 5: Foam</h4>
<p>If a thin gelatine binder is used in a sol-gel, the solution can be beaten like egg white into a low density insulating foam. I don’t know what this is useful for, but it’s neat.</p>
