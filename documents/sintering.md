Warning: the below is that dangerous mixture of dimly-remembered quotes and personal conjecture. I am not even slightly a materials scientist; corrections would be appreciated.



It is interesting to note that ceramics are, as far as I am aware, still a mainly empirical, non-predictive science. Even so, it can be helpful to understand some of the theory behind a process.

> What is the pattern, or the meaning, or the why? It does not do harm to the mystery to know a little about it. For far more marvelous is the truth than any artists of the past imagined it.

Distinct from the generally lower-temperature and more manageable liquid-phase sintering (as seen in SiC, barium titanate, etc), where a component of the mixture fully melts proper, high-alumina sintering is a purely vapor-phase *gas diffusion* process (with the exception of CuO-doped mixtures). 

At sufficient temperatures, a fraction of the molecules from one powder grain have sufficient energy to jump to another grain, forming a 'neck' which gradually closes into a solid. In fact, if the 'necking' process is allowed to go to completion [a phase known as *snogging* in lay circles], the material becomes transparent.

(Adding MgO tends to improve the homogeneity of this process, for reasons I do not understand).

Occurring simultaneously with this inter-particle process, dislocations within the crystalline structure of each pure grain are transported to boundaries, increasing the grain size. This sounds beneficial, but is actually a detrimental process. Large grains tend to produce stress concentrations, making a weak part. For this reason, dopants like TiO2 are added which re-introduce dislocations and prevent this grain-boundary growth. [More conjecture: for tio2 specifically there may also be a second-order, purely adhesive effect, since it bonds so readily with Al2O3.]

I find it somewhat counterintuitive to think of gas processes occurring with exclusively solid reactants, but there you go. The long, fuzzy, cute tails on the Stefan-Boltzmann distribution strike again.

When put into the context of a diffusion process, the complicated relationship between temperature, time, and sintering progress becomes more clear; and the qualitative pyrometric cone system used by pottery workers seems more sane.



This process can be accelerated by increasing the surface area of the solid reactants, along with their proximity, either by pressing the green, or applying pressure while sintering, as in hot-isostatic), or by applying an electric field. The effect of powder particle size can be quite striking; for example, [] observed a decrease in the sinter point of pure alumina from ~1600 C to ~1200 C simply by pre-milling the powder to exceptionally fine nanoparticles.



This last one is a mystery to modern science; in fact, nonconductive field-assisted sintering was discovered largely accidentally. The original name of SPS comes from It was thought that sparks were forming between grains of the metal powder, and this was providing an additional heating effect. Unfortunately for this hypothesis, sintering of non-conductive; and in fact it has not been demonstrated that sparks play any role whatsoever. 

FAST/SPS involves applying a controlled set of high-energy DC pulses to a 3-piece graphite mold. 

(Some speculation on my part: this seems closely related to Johnson-Rahbek / UEAC type electroadhesion / anodic bonding oft seen in semiconductors. In fact, this Johnson-Rahbek bonding can be harnessed on the macro scale; see bonding.)



Simple archimedes density and part strength are usually used to determine the sinter quality of a finished part.



Alumina is a low surface energy material; few elements can wet it and bond. Ti is exceptional, and is a general-purpose 'active metal', and is used
