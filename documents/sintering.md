Warning: the below is that dangerous mixture of dimly-remembered quotes and personal conjecture.



It is interesting to note that ceramics is, as far as I am aware, still a mainly empirical, non-predictive science. Even so, it can be helpful to understand some of the theory behind a process.

Distinct from the generally lower-temperature and more manageable liquid-phase sintering (as seen in SiC, barium titanate, etc), where a component of the mixture melts proper, high-alumina sintering is a purely vapor-phase *gas diffusion* process (with the exception of CuO-doped mixtures). 

At sufficient temperatures, a fraction of the molecules from one powder grain have sufficient energy to jump to another grain, forming a 'neck' which gradually closes into a solid. In fact, if the 'necks' are allowed to fully close, the material becomes transparent.

(Adding MgO tends to improve the homogeneity of this process, for reasons I do not understand).

Occurring simultaneously with this inter-particle process, dislocations within the crystalline structure of each pure grain are transported to boundaries, increasing the grain size. This sounds beneficial, but is actually a very destructive process, and is something to avoid. Large grains tend to produce stress concentrations, making a weak part. For this reason, dopants like CuO, TiO2 are added which re-add dislocations. 

I find it somewhat counterintuitive to think of gas process occurring with exclusively solid reactants, but there you go. The tails on the

This process can be accelerated by increasing the surface area of the solid reactants, along with their proximity, either by pressing the green, or applying pressure while sintering, as in hot-isostatic), or by applying an electric field. The effect of powder particle size can be quite striking; for example, [] observed a decrease in the sinter point of pure alumina from ~1600 C to ~1200 C simply by pre-milling the powder to exceptionally fine nanoparticles.



This last one is a mystery to modern science; in fact, nonconductive field-assisted sintering was discovered largely accidentally. The original name of SPS comes from It was thought that sparks were forming between grains of the metal powder, and this was providing an additional heating effect. Unfortunately for this hypothesis, sintering of non-conductive; and in fact it has not been demonstrated that sparks play any role whatsoever.

(speculation on my part: this seems closely related to Johnson-Rahbek / UEAC type electroadhesion / anodic bonding oft seen in semiconductors. In fact, this Johnson-Rahbek bonding can be harnessed on the macro scale; see bonding.)



Simple archimedes density and part strength are usually used to determine the sinter quality of a finished part.
