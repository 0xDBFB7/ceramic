# Ceramics as she is spoke

[References](./references.pdf) | [BibTeX](./bibtex.bib) 



A few months ago, it became apparent that a certain something would require several thousand ultra-high-temperature vacuum-safe ceramic insulators with arbitrary geometries, and the economics could only work out if the parts could later be produced in-house for less than $0.05 each. 

Moreover, I needed a reliable process with 30-minute turnaround for prototyping, without requiring specialized tooling beyond a PLA FDM 3d printer. 

Also, I had a budget of $300.

#### [Terse, simplified recipe]()



#### [Part 1: a $50 alumina sintering kiln]()

#### [Part 2: the blend]() (in progress)

#### [Part 3: characterization]() (in progress)

#### [Part 4: Forming & shaping]() (not in usable state)



Also, this is going to be almost entirely empirical; I don't have a theoretical basis for this work. Also, nothing I'm about to show is even remotely my invention, I'm just poorly implementing the work of several dozen papers.





You may wonder why this is being published in parts. Despite note-taking, the author finds it somewhat difficult to keep track of all the fine details required to replicate a process, especially if the whole pr	oject spans months or years. 

- Publishing half-baked (ha!) information sucks

- There is also rarely a well-defined endpoint at which something can be considered "ready to publish".
- Publishing pieces as they are finished allows the information to be useful immediately, rather than waiting years for every detail of the root project be complete. Unfortunately, further innovations may cause the whole process to be re-written, and equipment may become useless.
- Previous iterations of this report spanned ~10k words; this becomes quite unwieldy.

It's an experiment. Let me know what you think!



I certainly don't deserve any money for this drivel (the process is its own reward); however, the \$300 Mk2 furnace seems to be of sufficient utility that others may want one.  The break-even point is about 50 units. Please note that the kiln could be easily built yourself for \$70 and a few hours.
