## Process

0.5 vol of alumina, 0.5 vol water, 3% wt gelatin. Cured overnight in the fridge, though I think this was too long. Then I baked it at 70c for a few hours. The alumina layer seemed to settle to the bottom, forming a dense layer; a layer of water floated above. I'm not sure why.

## Results
